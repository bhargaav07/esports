    <p>In recent years, the gaming industry has witnessed an unprecedented rise in popularity, largely driven by the explosive growth of esports. Esports, short for electronic sports, refers to competitive gaming where players or teams compete in video games for glory, fame, and often, massive prize pools. This global phenomenon has transformed the way we perceive gaming, turning it into a professional career and a cultural movement.</p>
